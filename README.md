# PopularMovies
 
Devoted approx. 3 hours to complete this task, thus not everything in the app is polished.
The Api I used for this task to fetch is https://api.themoviedb.org/3/. 
1. I implemented MVVM architecture for this app, using Live Data. For displaying the movie posters, I used the recycler view. I also added the movie screen which displays the required details.
2. I used Retrofit 2 and Glide for working with the API. 
3. I am currently learning Kotlin Syntax and Coroutines and I did not spend more time to implement RxJava in this task. 
I added async task instead. 
4. The program is stable and running.
